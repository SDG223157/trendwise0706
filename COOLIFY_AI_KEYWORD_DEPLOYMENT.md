## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
Add these to your Coolify environment:

```bash
# AI Keyword Extraction
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key  # Optional: for advanced AI extraction
KEYWORD_EXTRACTION_ENABLED=true
SUGGESTIONS_CACHE_TIME=300  # 5 minutes

# Search Performance
MAX_SUGGESTIONS=10
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.6
ENABLE_SEARCH_ANALYTICS=true
```

### Database Configuration
The system creates these new tables:
- `news_keywords`: Extracted keywords with relevance scores
- `article_keywords`: Article-keyword relationships
- `keyword_similarities`: Semantic relationships
- `search_analytics`: User behavior tracking

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No keywords found" Error**
```bash
# Re-run keyword extraction
python3 extract_keywords_from_articles.py --batch-size 50
```

**2. Slow Suggestions**
```bash
# Check Redis connection
redis-cli ping

# Warm the cache
curl 'http://your-url/news/api/suggestions?q=earnings'
```

**3. API Endpoints Not Working**
```bash
# Check if tables exist
python3 -c "
from app import create_app, db
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    from sqlalchemy import inspect
    inspector = inspect(db.engine)
    tables = inspector.get_table_names()
    print('Tables:', [t for t in tables if 'keyword' in t])
"
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization

### Cache Warming
Run this after deployment to pre-populate the cache:

```bash
# Common search terms
curl 'http://your-url/news/api/suggestions?q=earnings'
curl 'http://your-url/news/api/suggestions?q=revenue'
curl 'http://your-url/news/api/suggestions?q=merger'
curl 'http://your-url/news/api/suggestions?q=technology'
```

### Keyword Extraction
For better keyword quality, run the full extraction:

```bash
# Extract keywords from all articles (may take time)
python3 extract_keywords_from_articles.py --all
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

    cutoff = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=30)
    old_analytics = SearchAnalytics.query.filter(SearchAnalytics.created_at < cutoff).delete()
