Fix False Sync Reporting

The scheduler uses two different sync detection logics:
1. Actual sync detection (works correctly) - finds 0 articles needing sync
2. Reporting logic (broken) - requires exact content matches, causing false failures

This script fixes the reporting logic to match the actual sync detection.
