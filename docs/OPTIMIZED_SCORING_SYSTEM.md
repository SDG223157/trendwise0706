# TrendWise Optimized Scoring System

## Overview

The Optimized Scoring System enhances the original TrendWise scoring methodology with advanced metrics, better differentiation, and more sophisticated analysis techniques. This system provides more accurate and nuanced stock assessments while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Component Structure**

#### Original System (3 Components)

#### Optimized System (4 Components + Risk Metrics)
- **Trend Analysis**: 40% base weight (dynamic)
- **Return Performance**: 35% weight
- **Volatility Risk**: 15% weight
- **Momentum Analysis**: 10% weight (NEW)
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Integrated throughout

### 2. **Advanced Risk Metrics**

The optimized system incorporates multiple risk-adjusted performance measures:

#### Sharpe Ratio Enhancement
- Measures risk-adjusted returns

- Focuses on downside deviation only
- Better assessment of harmful volatility
- Weight: 35% in risk-adjusted score

#### Calmar Ratio (NEW)
- Return relative to maximum drawdown
- Measures recovery capability
- Weight: 20% in risk-adjusted score

#### Omega Ratio (NEW)
- Probability-weighted ratio of gains vs losses
- Comprehensive risk-return assessment

### 3. **Enhanced Trend Analysis**

#### Multiple Trend Indicators
1. **Polynomial Regression** (Original method retained)
2. **Moving Average Strength** (NEW)
   - Analysis across 20, 50, and 200-day MAs
   - Measures price position relative to MAs
3. **Trend Persistence** (NEW)

   - Identifies strengthening/weakening trends

#### Composite Trend Score Formula
```
Trend Score = (R² × 0.30) + (MA Strength × 0.25) + 
              (Persistence × 0.20) + (Efficiency × 0.15) + 
              (Acceleration × 0.10)
```

### 4. **Momentum Component (NEW)**

Comprehensive momentum analysis including:

#### Rate of Change (ROC)
- Short-term (20 days): 25% weight
- Medium-term (60 days): 25% weight
- Long-term (120 days): 20% weight

#### Technical Indicators

- **Momentum Consistency**: 10% weight

### 5. **Market Regime Detection (NEW)**

Dynamic weight adjustment based on market conditions:

#### Bull Market
- Trend: 45%, Return: 35%, Volatility: 10%, Momentum: 10%

#### Bear Market
- Trend: 30%, Return: 35%, Volatility: 25%, Momentum: 10%

#### High Volatility
- Trend: 35%, Return: 30%, Volatility: 25%, Momentum: 10%

#### Normal Market

### 6. **Confidence Multipliers**

R²-based confidence adjustments:

| R² Range | Multiplier | Classification |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| ≥ 0.90   | 1.25       | Ultra High     |
| ≥ 0.80   | 1.15       | Very High      |
| ≥ 0.70   | 1.10       | High           |
| ≥ 0.60   | 1.05       | Moderate       |
| ≥ 0.50   | 1.00       | Low            |
| < 0.50   | 0.85       | Very Low       |

### 7. **Enhanced Rating System**

More granular ratings with 10 levels:

| Score Range | Rating | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| ≥ 110 | Legendary | Exceptional ultra-performers |
| ≥ 95 | Exceptional | Outstanding performers |
| ≥ 85 | Excellent | Strong performers |
| ≥ 75 | Very Good | Above-average performers |
| ≥ 65 | Good | Solid performers |
| ≥ 55 | Above Average | Decent performers |
| ≥ 45 | Average | Market performers |
| ≥ 35 | Below Average | Underperformers |
| ≥ 25 | Poor | Significant underperformers |
| < 25 | Very Poor | Severe underperformers |

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.utils.analysis.scoring_integration import ScoringIntegration

# Get enhanced analysis with backward compatibility
enhanced_analysis = ScoringIntegration.get_enhanced_stock_analysis(
    data=stock_data,
    symbol='AAPL',
    sp500_data=sp500_data
)

# Access the enhanced score
final_score = enhanced_analysis['total_score']['score']
rating = enhanced_analysis['total_score']['rating']

# Access new metrics
risk_metrics = enhanced_analysis['total_score']['enhanced_metrics']['risk_metrics']
momentum = enhanced_analysis['total_score']['enhanced_metrics']['momentum']
confidence = enhanced_analysis['total_score']['enhanced_metrics']['confidence_level']
```

### Comparison Mode

```python
# Compare original vs optimized scoring
comparison = ScoringIntegration.compare_scoring_methods(
    data=stock_data,

    use_optimized=True
)

# Access both scores
original_score = comparison['original']['final_score']
optimized_score = comparison['optimized']['final_score']
improvements = comparison['comparison']['improvements']
```
