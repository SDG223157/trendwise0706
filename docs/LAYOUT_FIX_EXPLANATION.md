# AI Summary Layout Fix

## Issue Description

The AI Summary and AI Insights sections were displaying as plain text instead of the structured, formatted layout that was intended. The content appeared as unformatted paragraphs rather than organized sections with proper headers and bullet points.

## Root Cause

The JavaScript parsing functions in `app/templates/news/fetch.html` were designed to parse content that was already structured with specific section headers like:
- "Key Concepts/Keywords"
- "Key Points" 
- "Context"
- "Key Insights"
- "Market Implications"
- "Conclusion"

However, the actual AI-generated content from the database had a different format:
- **AI Summary**: Single paragraph of unstructured text
- **AI Insights**: Semi-structured text with section headers like "Key Market Drivers & Trends:", "Energy Sector Opportunities", etc., but not matching the expected format

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Content Detection
Added logic to detect whether content is already structured or needs formatting:

```javascript
const hasStructuredSections = summary.toLowerCase().includes('key concepts') || 
                            summary.toLowerCase().includes('key points') || 
                            summary.toLowerCase().includes('context');
```

### 2. Fallback Formatting for Unstructured Content

**For AI Summary:**
- If unstructured: Break into sentences and display as formatted paragraphs
- Maintains readability while adding structure

**For AI Insights:**
- If unstructured: Parse section headers that end with colons or contain key phrases
- Automatically detect sections like "Key Market Drivers & Trends:", "Actionable Trading/Investment Strategies:", etc.
- Format each section with proper headers and bullet points

### 3. Flexible Section Detection
Added detection for various section header patterns:
- Lines ending with colons (`:`)
- Specific phrases like "key market drivers", "energy sector opportunities", "monetary policy outlook"
- "actionable trading", "risk management", "conclusion", etc.

## Code Changes

### Before (Rigid Structure Expected)
```javascript
// Only worked if content had exact section headers
if (trimmed.toLowerCase().includes('key concepts')) {
    currentSection = 'concepts';
}
```

### After (Flexible Content Handling)
```javascript
// Detects if content is structured or unstructured
const hasStructuredSections = insights.toLowerCase().includes('key insights') || 
                            insights.toLowerCase().includes('market implications') || 
                            insights.toLowerCase().includes('conclusion');

if (hasStructuredSections) {
    // Parse structured content
} else {
    // Handle unstructured content with flexible section detection
    if (line.endsWith(':') || 
        line.toLowerCase().includes('key market drivers') ||
        line.toLowerCase().includes('energy sector opportunities') ||
        // ... more patterns
    ) {
        // Create new section
    }
}
```

## Result

Now the layout properly displays:

### AI Summary Section (Blue Background)
- **Summary** header
- Formatted paragraphs with proper spacing
- Clean, readable text structure

### AI Insights Section (Purple Background)  
- **Key Market Drivers & Trends** with bullet points
- **Energy Sector Opportunities** with bullet points
- **Monetary Policy Outlook** with bullet points
- **Actionable Trading/Investment Strategies** with subsections
- **Risk Management** with bullet points
- **Conclusion** with formatted text

## Benefits

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both old unstructured content and new structured content
2. **Automatic Formatting**: No need to manually reprocess existing articles
3. **Flexible Parsing**: Adapts to various content formats and section naming conventions
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper headers, spacing, and bullet points improve readability
5. **Responsive Design**: Maintains side-by-side layout on desktop, stacks on mobile

## Testing

Created `test_content_parsing.html` to verify the parsing logic works correctly with real content from the database. The test file demonstrates:
- Proper section detection
- Correct bullet point formatting
- Appropriate header styling
- Responsive layout behavior

## Future Improvements

1. **AI Prompt Updates**: Update AI prompts to generate content in the expected structured format
2. **Content Migration**: Use the Reset AI Summaries feature to reprocess articles with updated prompts
3. **Enhanced Detection**: Add more section header patterns as new content formats are discovered
4. **Validation**: Add content quality checks to ensure proper formatting

This fix ensures that all existing and future AI-generated content displays properly in the structured layout, regardless of the original format.
