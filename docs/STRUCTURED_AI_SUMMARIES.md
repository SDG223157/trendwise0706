## Implementation

### 1. Updated AI Prompts

All AI generation now uses explicit structured prompts:

**Summary Prompt:**
```
Analyze this news article and create a structured summary using EXACTLY this format:

**Key Concepts/Keywords**
- [Extract 3-5 key financial/market concepts, company names, or important terms]
- [Each item should be a specific concept, not generic placeholders]

**Key Points**
- [Extract 3-5 main factual points from the article]
- [Focus on concrete facts, numbers, events, or developments]

**Context**
- [Provide 2-4 background context items that help understand the significance]
- [Include market conditions, historical context, or related developments]

IMPORTANT: Replace ALL bracketed placeholders with actual content from the article.
```

**Insights Prompt:**
```
Analyze this news article and create structured financial insights using EXACTLY this format:

**Key Insights**
- [Extract 3-5 key financial insights, market trends, or strategic implications]
- [Focus on actionable insights for investors and traders]

**Market Implications**
- [Identify 2-4 specific market implications or potential impacts]
- [Consider effects on sectors, competitors, or broader markets]

**Conclusion**
- [Provide a clear, concise conclusion summarizing the overall significance]

IMPORTANT: Replace ALL bracketed placeholders with actual insights from the article.
```

### 2. Frontend Parsing

The frontend automatically detects and formats structured content:

```javascript
const formatAISummary = (summary) => {
    // Check if content is structured
    const hasStructuredSections = summary.toLowerCase().includes('key concepts') || 
                                summary.toLowerCase().includes('key points') || 
                                summary.toLowerCase().includes('context');
    
    if (hasStructuredSections) {
        // Parse and format structured content
        return parseStructuredContent(summary);
    } else {
        // Handle legacy unstructured content
        return formatUnstructuredContent(summary);
    }
};
```

### 3. Visual Layout

The structured content displays in a professional two-column layout:

- **Left Column (Blue)**: AI Summary with Key Concepts, Key Points, and Context
- **Right Column (Purple)**: AI Insights with Key Insights, Market Implications, and Conclusion
- **Bottom**: AI Sentiment Rating badge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Unstructured Output
**Problem**: AI returns unstructured text
**Solution**: Check prompt formatting, retry processing

#### Missing Sections
**Problem**: AI skips required sections
**Solution**: Verify content quality, adjust prompts if needed

#### Placeholder Text
**Problem**: AI returns "Keyword 1", "Point 1" etc.
**Solution**: Enhanced prompts now explicitly forbid placeholders

#### Processing Failures
**Problem**: Articles fail to process
**Solution**: Check API connectivity, content length, rate limits

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check structured content ratio
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ai_summary LIKE '%**Key Concepts%' THEN 1 END) as structured,
    COUNT(*) as total
FROM news_articles 
WHERE ai_summary IS NOT NULL;

# Find unstructured content
SELECT id, title, ai_summary 
FROM news_articles 
WHERE ai_summary IS NOT NULL 
AND ai_summary NOT LIKE '%**Key Concepts%'
LIMIT 10;
```
