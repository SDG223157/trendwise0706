# Latest Keyword Functionality

## Overview

The "latest" keyword in TrendWise search has been enhanced to provide a time-filtered view of articles from the last 3 days, sorted from newest to oldest. This feature helps users quickly find the most recent and relevant news articles.

## Features

### 1. Time-Based Filtering
- **Filter Range**: Articles published within the last 3 days
- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects the "latest" keyword in search queries
- **Sort Order**: Articles are sorted from newest to oldest (latest first)

### 2. Search Integration
- **Keyword Search**: Works with `search_by_keywords()` method
- **Symbol Search**: Works with `search_by_symbols()` method when no specific symbols are provided
- **Mixed Search**: Supported in hybrid search scenarios

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **UI Badge**: Shows "üïê Last 3 Days" indicator when "latest" filter is active
- **Color Coding**: Purple badge (`text-purple-600`) to distinguish from other filters

## Usage Examples

### Basic Latest Search
```
Search query: "latest"
Result: Shows all articles from the last 3 days, sorted newest first
```

### Latest with Keywords
```
Search query: "latest tech"
Result: Shows tech-related articles from the last 3 days
```

### Latest with Region
```
Search query: "latest china"
Result: Shows Chinese news articles from the last 3 days
```

### Combined Filters
```
Search query: "latest highest"
Result: Shows articles from last 3 days with highest sentiment ratings
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Processing

#### 1. Query Detection
- The `_parse_unified_search_params()` function detects "latest" in the search query
- Sets `search_params['has_latest'] = True` flag
- Removes "latest" from the keywords list for content matching

#### 2. Search Enhancement
- `OptimizedNewsSearch` class enhanced with `_has_latest_keyword` flag
- Date filtering applied using `published_at >= three_days_ago`
- Overrides sort order to 'LATEST' to ensure newest first

#### 3. Database Query
```python
# Date filter for last 3 days
three_days_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=3)
query = query.filter(NewsSearchIndex.published_at >= three_days_ago)
```

### Frontend Display

#### 1. Search Results
- Articles are displayed with standard AI-enhanced formatting
- Time filter is clearly indicated with purple "üïê Last 3 Days" badge
- Combines with other filters (region, sentiment) seamlessly

#### 2. Visual Indicators
```html
{% if search_params.get('has_latest') %}
    <span class="text-purple-600 font-medium">üïê Last 3 Days</span>
{% endif %}
```
